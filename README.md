## 🛠️ Built With

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For scripting and type safety.
- **HTML & CSS**: The backbone of web development.

### Automated tests

Automated tests are usually placed into the `test` or, less commonly, into the `spec` or `tests` folder.

> **Q: Why tests are placed into a separate folder, as opposed to having them closer to the code under test?**
>
> **A:** Because you don't want to test the code, you want to test the *program*.
